- Always start working with a plan. It feels like unnecessary at first but extremely helpful for complex feature.
- We must be patient while teaching others and take break to keep cool.

- **PM2 cluster mode** can run multiple instances of an app at the same time, you must set "instances" amount in the config.
- When you're publishing it for the crowd, you must be serious about resources.

## 01/02/2025
- Taking break is a must. Sometimes you need to take break from work and sometimes take break from a project.
- Keep learning no matter what. Learning should be a hobby.
- Don't work on any feature if you're not clear about the basic requirements.
- A function is pure if it only use local variables. (ex: parameters and variables defiend inside it's block)
- If a function uses varaibles outside it's block or from it's lexical environment then it creates a closure.
  ```js
  function outer(name) {
    return function inner(greet) {
      console.log(greet + " " + name);
    }
  }
  ```

- Engineering is all about problem solving, we solve the problems that normally we can't think of.

## 01/06/2025
- Sometimes you have to stop doing the things that you want, to be able to do what you have to.
- If you don't waste any time in the day you'll eventually feel better and better.
- While solving complex problem, you must take breaks and walk.
-Walking just works and gives you time to think and approach the problem in a different way.

## 01/07/2025

- Then chaining is also cool and I've used it at many places, it also solves the issue of callback hell.

  ```js
  demo()
    .then(data => processData(data))
    .then(processedData => saveData(processedData))
    .then(result => console.log("Result:", result))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error:", err));
  ```

## 01/15/2025

- There are some common ones:
  - Short videos (Reduces attention span)

## 01/16/2025
- Decay in focus and energy occurs while you're dealing with difficulties.

- Overwhelm comes when you see the problem as one massive task.

  - Plan what is the first step.
  - Plan what is the last step where you stop.

- The purpose of life should come first and everything after that.
- Without that purpose you may wander and fall over and over again.
- The next milestone you're pursuing should **help** you toward that purpose not **divert** you from that.
- This is why even after completing things you may feel lost.
