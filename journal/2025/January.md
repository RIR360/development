- A function is pure if it only use local variables. (ex: parameters and variables defiend inside it's block)
- If a function uses varaibles outside it's block or from it's lexical environment then it creates a closure.

  function outer(name) {
    return function inner(greet) {
      console.log(greet + " " + name);
    }
  }
  ```
